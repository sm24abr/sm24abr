- 👋 Hi, I'm Smitha Abraham and a data science enthusiast.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Data science and AI from INSAID institute. I am working on some projects to enhance my learning on the subject.
- 💞️ I prefer to use Python language because it is certainly a user friendly language and easy to use 
- 💞️ I have had a flair for data analysis from a very young age. I was always excited at how the same problem could be approached in multiple ways.
